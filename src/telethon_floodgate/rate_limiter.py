"""Per-account sliding-window rate limiter for live ``auth.resolveUsername``
calls (#551).

The reactive backoff added in #502 only kicks in *after* Telegram has already
returned a multi-hour ``FLOOD_WAIT_X``. By then the damage is done: production
logs show a single fresh session firing 160+ ``resolve_username`` calls in
seconds, escalating to 15–18 hour flood waits.

This limiter caps the *burst* before it happens. It is a pure in-memory,
per-account sliding window — no DB, no locks — so it is cheap to consult on the
hot resolve path. When an account exceeds its window the caller defers the
channel (short reschedule) instead of issuing the live API call.
